In this example, the Model component fetches data from data.json. Since its is a json rather than API i simulate the process of response I just pass the value insdie the data.json to the state. The View component maps over the array of items and renders each item in a pre-made component card consisting of the color,Housename and from of the card. The Controller component acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, passing the array of items as a prop to the View.
